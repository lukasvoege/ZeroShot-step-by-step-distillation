This can be achieved by reducing portion sizes, avoiding sugary and processed foods, and opting for nutrient-dense, low-calorie options.\n\n2. Balanced Diet: Focus on consuming a balanced diet consisting of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. This helps provide essential nutrients while keeping calorie intake in check.\n\n3. Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid overeating. Using smaller plates, measuring food quantities, and practicing portion control techniques can help manage calorie intake effectively.\n\n4. Regular Exercise: While the question provided options, it's worth mentioning that incorporating regular exercise along with a healthy diet is highly beneficial for weight loss. Increasing stamina and getting fitter through cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and other physical activities can help burn calories and accelerate weight loss.\n\n5. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, our body confuses thirst with hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Staying hydrated can help curb unnecessary food cravings.\n\n6. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who can provide personalized guidance and create an appropriate meal plan tailored to individual needs and goals.\n\nRemember, losing mass in a healthy and sustainable manner takes time and consistency. It is important to focus on overall good health rather than just weight loss."}
