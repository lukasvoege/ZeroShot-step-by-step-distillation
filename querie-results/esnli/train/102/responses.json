While we know that two toddlers are playing with toys on a table, we do not have specific information about the type of toys they are playing with.

However, we cannot determine the reason behind her actions solely based on this information. It is possible that she is doing these things because she is happy, but it could also be due to other reasons such as excitement, playfulness, or simply enjoying the moment.
