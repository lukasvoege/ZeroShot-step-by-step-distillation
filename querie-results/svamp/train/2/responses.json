If he gained the same number of points each round\nHow many points did he score per round?\\n\\nGo step by step, but clearly state your final answer.", "response": "To find out how many points Luke scored per round, we need to divide the total number of points he scored by the number of rounds he played.\n\nLet's denote the number of points Luke scored per round as \"x\".\n\nSince Luke played 2 rounds and gained the same number of points each round, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2x = 84\n\nTo find the value of \"x\", we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n2x/2 = 84/2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 42\n\nTherefore, Luke scored 42 points per round."}

If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet\nWhat is the length of her room?\\n\\nGo step by step, but clearly state your final answer.", "response": "To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\n\nWe know that the width of Jesse's room is 7 feet and the area of the carpet she needs is 14 square feet. Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n\n14 = Length \u00d7 7\n\nTo solve for the length, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n14 \u00f7 7 = Length \u00d7 7 \u00f7 7\n\n2 = Length\n\nTherefore, the length of Jesse's room is 2 feet."}
