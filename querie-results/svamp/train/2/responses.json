Therefore, each basket contains a total of 19 + 4 = 23 peaches.\n\nSince there are 15 baskets, we multiply the number of peaches in each basket (23) by the number of baskets (15):\n\n23 peaches/basket * 15 baskets = 345 peaches.\n\nTherefore, there are 345 peaches in the baskets altogether."}

We know that Frank read 22 pages per day.\n2. We also know that it took him 569 days to finish the book.\n3. To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the number of pages Frank read per day by the number of days it took him to finish the book.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\nTotal number of pages = Number of pages read per day x Number of days\nTotal number of pages = 22 pages/day x 569 days\nTotal number of pages = 12,518 pages\n\nTherefore, there are 12,518 pages in the book."}
