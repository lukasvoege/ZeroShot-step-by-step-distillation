These sources are generally reliable and widely accepted in the film industry.\n\nSecondly, Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek's career trajectory aligns with someone who was born and raised in Prague. He studied filmmaking at the Barrandov Studio Training School, which is located in Prague. This suggests a local connection to the city.\n\nFurthermore, Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek's early work in the Czech New Wave, specifically his collaboration with Milo\u0161 Forman, also supports the idea that he was born in Prague.
