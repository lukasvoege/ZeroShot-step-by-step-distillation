This renowned film school is located in Prague, further supporting the notion that he was born in the city.\n\n4. Collaboration with Milo\u0161 Forman: Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek collaborated extensively with director Milo\u0161 Forman, working on multiple films together, including \"Talent Competition,\" \"Hair,\" \"Ragtime,\" and \"Amadeus.\" Forman, a Czech-born filmmaker, had a significant career in Czechoslovakia before moving to the United States. The fact that Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek collaborated with Forman both in Czechoslovakia and the US suggests that he also had roots in Prague.\n\nWhile it is important to consider the credibility and accuracy of the sources providing this information, these points of evidence collectively support the notion that Miroslav Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek was indeed born in Prague, Czechoslovakia."}

Research report on women's prisons: As stated in the prompt, Charlotte Anley spent two years in Australia researching women's prisons, specifically commissioned by Elizabeth Fry. This suggests that she had a vested interest in the conditions and treatment of women in prisons.\n\n2. Quaker beliefs: Being a Quaker, it is likely that Anley adhered to the Quaker principles of social justice and equality. Quakers have a long history of advocating for prison reform and humane treatment of prisoners. This aligns with Anley's research on women's prisons and implies her opposition to the mistreatment of incarcerated women.\n\n3. Didactic novelist and social writer: Anley's work as a didactic novelist and social writer suggests that she had a strong moral compass and a desire to educate and advocate for social issues. It is reasonable to assume that her writings would reflect her concerns about the treatment of women in prisons.\n\n4. Lack of evidence to the contrary: If there is no evidence to suggest that Anley supported the mistreatment of women in prisons, it strengthens the argument that she was against such treatment. Absence of contradictory evidence can be seen as indirect support for the notion.\n\nTo refute the notion that Charlotte Anley was against the treatment of women in prisons, evidence would need to be presented showing her support for such mistreatment. Without such evidence, the arguments presented above strongly support the idea that Anley was indeed opposed to the mistreatment of women in prisons."}
