Neither of these brewing locations is in Ireland, which suggests that the beer may not have a significant presence or popularity among Irish consumers.\n\n2. Market focus: The marketing of Killian's red beer may claim a legacy to an Irish recipe, but this does not necessarily imply that it is consumed predominantly by Irish people. Companies often use marketing strategies that create an association with a particular culture or heritage to appeal to a wider audience. Therefore, it is possible that the claim is more about leveraging the perception of Irish authenticity as a marketing tactic rather than reflecting actual consumption patterns in Ireland.\n\n3.
