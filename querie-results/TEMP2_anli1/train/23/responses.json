These countries have a strong tradition of consuming Irish cream and are known for their significant demand for this type of liqueur.\n\nLastly, Bailey's is widely recognized as the most famous Irish cream. Bailey's Irish Cream, produced by Diageo, is a well-established and highly popular brand that has achieved global recognition. It is often used as a generic term for Irish cream, indicating its dominance in the market.
