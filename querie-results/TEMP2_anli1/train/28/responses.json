However, as of my last update in October 2021, I can provide some general information about the Maharishi Peace Palace and its association with the Transcendental Meditation movement.\n\nThe Maharishi Peace Palace is indeed a type of pre-engineered building designed to accommodate the educational and meditational activities of the Transcendental Meditation movement. These buildings are constructed using standardized plans that align with the principles of Maharishi Sthapatya Veda design.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Peace Palace is to create an ideal environment for practicing Transcendental Meditation and related activities. These buildings often include meditation halls, classrooms, and other facilities necessary for teaching and learning various aspects of the Transcendental Meditation technique.\n\nHowever, whether or not the Maharishi Peace Palace is considered a worshipping house may vary depending on individual perspectives and beliefs. While the Transcendental Meditation movement has spiritual aspects, it is not typically considered a religious practice in the traditional sense. Transcendental Meditation is often viewed as a technique for personal development and inner peace.\n\nTherefore, it would be more accurate to describe the Peace Palace as a place for meditation and education rather than a worshipping house. However, it is essential to consider that interpretations and practices may vary among individuals within the Transcendental Meditation movement.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information available to me, it is clear that the Maharishi Peace Palace is designed as a pre-engineered building for the educational and meditational activities of the Transcendental Meditation movement. While it is associated with spiritual practices, it is not necessarily considered a worshipping house in the traditional religious sense."}
