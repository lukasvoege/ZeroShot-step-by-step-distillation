The information provided about Bob Welch's album \"The Other One\" and its connection to the band TOOL is incorrect. Bob Welch was not involved in TOOL, and there is no album by TOOL called \"The Other One\" for which Welch provided backing vocals.\n\nHowever, to address the first part of the question, the connection between Bob Welch's album \"The Other One\" and Fleetwood Mac can be supported by several pieces of evidence:\n\n1. Bob Welch's tenure in Fleetwood Mac: Before pursuing a solo career, Bob Welch was a guitarist and vocalist for Fleetwood Mac. He joined the band in 1971 and contributed to several albums, including \"Future Games\" released in 1971. This demonstrates his connection to Fleetwood Mac.\n\n2. \"Future Games\" track on both albums: The track \"Future Games\" appeared on Fleetwood Mac's album of the same name in 1971, which featured Bob Welch as a member of the band. Later, Welch released his solo album \"The Other One,\" which also included the track \"Future Games.\" This indicates a connection between the two albums.\n\n3. Songwriting contributions from Welch's backing band: It is mentioned that members of Welch's backing band contributed to the songwriting on \"The Other One.\" This demonstrates the involvement of other musicians in the creation of the album, further supporting the connection to Welch's Fleetwood Mac background.\n\nIn summary, the evidence provided supports the connection between Bob Welch's solo album \"The Other One\" and his involvement with Fleetwood Mac, particularly through the track \"Future Games\" and the contributions from his backing band. However, there is no connection between Bob Welch and the band TOOL."}

For example, on September 19, 2012, Logo TV's Senior Vice President of Original Programming and Development, Brent Zacky, stated that the channel was \"evolving from a niche gay network to a general cultural destination.\"\n\n2. Programming changes: The programming lineup on Logo TV underwent significant changes in 2012. The channel began to introduce more non-LGBT-focused shows and expanded its content to include a wider range of cultural and lifestyle programming. Examples of this include the addition of shows like \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and \"Finding Prince Charming,\" which brought in a broader audience beyond the LGBT community.\n\n3. Rebranding efforts: In line with the shift in content focus, Logo TV underwent a rebranding process in 2012. The channel updated its logo, on-air graphics, and promotional materials to reflect a more inclusive and diverse image. This rebranding was a clear indication of the channel's intention to appeal to a broader audience.\n\n4. Audience targeting: Alongside the programming changes, Logo TV also adjusted its marketing and advertising strategies to reach a wider demographic.
