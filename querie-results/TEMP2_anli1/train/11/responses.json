The fact that the main characters are poets suggests that the story will be told from their perspective.\n\n2. Author's background: Roberto Bola\u00f1o himself was a poet before becoming a novelist. Bola\u00f1o often drew inspiration from his own experiences and the literary world, and it is not uncommon for authors to incorporate elements of their own lives and interests into their works. Given that Bola\u00f1o was a poet, it is likely that he would write a novel from the viewpoint of poets.\n\n3. The literary style: The narrative structure of The Savage Detectives consists of testimonies, interviews, letters, and diary entries from various characters. This allows the reader to directly access the thoughts, emotions, and perspectives of the characters, including the two poets, Belano and Lima. The use of these literary devices suggests that the story is being told from multiple viewpoints, including those of the poets.\n\n4. Poetic themes and language: Throughout the novel, there are numerous discussions about poetry, literature, and the role of the poet in society.

Standardized plans: Maharishi Peace Palaces are built using standardized plans. This suggests that there is a specific design and layout intended for these buildings, which aligns with the purpose of creating a consistent space for the practice of Transcendental Meditation.\n\n2. Maharishi Sthapatya Veda design principles: The Peace Palaces are designed based on the principles of Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, an architectural system that emphasizes creating structures in harmony with natural laws and promoting balance and positivity. This indicates that the buildings are intended to provide an environment conducive to meditation and spiritual practices.\n\n3. Educational and meditational activities: The purpose of the Peace Palaces is to house both educational and meditational activities. This suggests that these buildings serve as a dedicated space for people to engage in spiritual practices, learning, and personal growth. Such activities are often associated with worshipping or religious practices.\n\n4. Association with the Transcendental Meditation movement: The Peace Palaces are specifically affiliated with the Transcendental Meditation movement. This movement has spiritual and philosophical underpinnings and is often considered a form of New Age spirituality. The association with this movement further supports the idea that the Peace Palaces can be seen as places of worship.\n\nWhile the evidence suggests that the Maharishi Peace Palace is primarily designed to facilitate educational and meditational activities, it is reasonable to conclude that these activities can also be seen as forms of worship within the context of the Transcendental Meditation movement."}

This information is commonly found in biographies, film databases, and obituaries.\n\n2. Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek studied filmmaking at the Barrandov Studio Training School, which is located in Prague. This suggests that he was living in Prague during his formative years and had access to local film education.\n\n3. Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek began his filmmaking career during the Czech New Wave, a movement that emerged in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. This movement was centered in Prague and involved a group of Czech filmmakers who sought artistic and political freedom. Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek's involvement in this movement further supports his connection to Prague.\n\n4. Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek collaborated extensively with Czech director Milo\u0161 Forman, both in Czechoslovakia and later in the United States. Their first collaboration, \"Talent Competition,\" was a Czech film made in Prague. This implies that Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek was already based in Prague at the time.\n\n5.

However, his earlier connections to Prague and the Czech New Wave indicate his origins in the city.\n\nWhile these pieces of evidence strongly support the conclusion that Miroslav Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek was born in Prague, it is always important to verify information from reliable sources for complete accuracy."}

This indicates her dedication to understanding the conditions and treatment of women in prisons.\n\n2.
