premise: The Other One is the third solo album by former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Bob Welch. The track "Future Games" was first released on the Fleetwood Mac album of the same name in 1971. Members of Welchs backing band also make songwriting contributions here though the majority of tracks are Welchs own.
hypothesis: The Other One is an album by the group TOOL, for which Bob Welch did most of the backing vocals.
label: neutral
explanation: neutral - No, we cannot determine the validity of the claim based on the given information. The information provided only describes Bob Welchs solo album and mentions his backing band and songwriting contributions. There is no mention of the group TOOL or any album called "The Other One" by TOOL. Therefore, we lack evidence to support or refute the claim that "The Other One" is an album by the group TOOL with Bob Welch doing most of the backing vocals.

premise: Theodora Kracaw Kroeber Quinn (March 24, 1897 \u2013 July 4, 1979) was a writer and anthropologist, best known for her accounts of Ishi, the last member of the Yahi tribe of California, and for her retelling of traditional narratives from several Native Californian cultures.
hypothesis: Theodora Kracaw Kroeber Quinn was over a hundred years old when she died.
label: contradiction
explanation: contradiction - Yes, we can determine the validity of the claim based on the information provided. The information states that Theodora Kracaw Kroeber Quinn was born on March 24, 1897, and died on July 4, 1979. By subtracting her birth year from her death year, we can determine that she lived for 82 years. Therefore, the claim that she was over a hundred years old when she died is not valid based on the provided information.

label: entailment
explanation: entailment - Yes, we can determine the validity of the claim based on the information provided. The information clearly states that in 2012, Logo TV shifted its focus towards general cultural and lifestyle programming from its original aim of targeting primarily LGBT viewers. This supports the claim that in 2012, the channel Logo redirected their content. The evidence provided gives a clear indication of the change in programming direction, validating the claim.

hypothesis: Ward retired in his 8th season
label: contradiction
explanation: contradiction - The passage states that Peter Thomas Ward played 9 seasons in Major League Baseball.
