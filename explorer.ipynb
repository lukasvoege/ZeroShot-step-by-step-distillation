      "Based on the information provided, we can determine that the claim \"The current Isanti County Courthouse is located at 237 2nd Avenue, South West\" is not valid. \n",
      "\n",
      "The given information clearly states that the former Isanti County Courthouse is located at 237 2nd Avenue, South West, in Cambridge, Minnesota. It goes on to mention that the building has been remodeled into a private office building known as Court House Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it is referred to as the former courthouse and has been repurposed into an office building, it can be inferred that it is no longer the current Isanti County Courthouse. Therefore, the claim cannot be valid based on the evidence provided.\n",

      "Yes, we can determine the validity of the claim \"He was born in Prague\" based on the information provided. The evidence presented states that Miroslav Ondříček was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia. It also mentions that Prague is now located in Czech Republic. This information suggests that Ondříček was born in the city of Prague, which was part of Czechoslovakia at the time and is now in the Czech Republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the information provided about Ondříček's education and career in filmmaking does not contradict the claim of him being born in Prague. Instead, it supports the claim by mentioning his work during the Czech New Wave and his collaborations with Miloš Forman, both of which indicate his connection to the Czech film industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the evidence provided, we can determine that the claim \"He was born in Prague\" is valid.\n",

      "Yes, based on the information provided, we can determine the validity of the claim that \"Anley was against the treatment of women in prisons.\" The evidence provided states that Anley was a Quaker and that she spent time researching women's prisons in Australia for a report commissioned by Elizabeth Fry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Quaker religious tradition promotes values of equality, justice, and humanitarianism. Quakers have a long history of advocating for social justice issues, including prison reform. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Anley, being a Quaker, would be motivated by these values and would likely have been critical of the treatment of women in prisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the fact that Anley specifically researched women's prisons and produced a report on the topic suggests her active involvement and concern in addressing the conditions and treatment of women in the criminal justice system. This further supports the claim that Anley was against the treatment of women in prisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the evidence provided strongly suggests that Anley was indeed against the treatment of women in prisons, based on her Quaker background and her active involvement in researching and reporting on the topic of women's prisons.\n",

      "\n",
      "Additionally, the information mentions that Clerodendrum is currently classified in the subfamily Ajugoideae, which is also in accordance with the claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the claim states that Clerodendrum was one of several to be found in 1980, whereas the given information does not mention anything about the time of discovery of Clerodendrum. Therefore, we cannot determine the validity of this specific part of the claim based on the provided information.\n",

      "\n",
      "The information clearly states that Abesim is a town in the Sunyani Municipal District, which is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. This indicates that Abesim is indeed situated within the Brong-Ahafo Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it is mentioned that Abesim is very close to the regional capital town of the Brong-Ahafo Region, Sunyani. This further confirms that Abesim is part of the Brong-Ahafo Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the information mentions two educational institutions in Abesim: St. James Seminary and Secondary School, as well as Olistar Senior High School. Both of these schools are located in Abesim, which reinforces the fact that Abesim is within the Brong-Ahafo Region.\n",

      "To determine the popularity of a railway, we would need information such as passenger and freight traffic volume, number of trains operating on the line, customer satisfaction ratings, or any relevant surveys or statistics. Without such information, it is not possible to make a conclusive judgment on the popularity of the Aurora Subdivision.\n",

The information states that Fußball Club Südburgenland has played in the ÖFB-Frauenliga (OFB-Women's League) since the 2003-04 season. This directly supports the claim that the club has played in the league since that season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the information provides the history and background of the club, stating that it was founded in 2002 and became an independent club after the women's team of SC Pinkafeld decided to separate. This further strengthens the credibility of the claim, as it gives context to the club's establishment and subsequent participation in the ÖFB-Frauenliga.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine the validity of the claim, we would need additional evidence such as sales figures, market share data, consumer surveys, or brand recognition studies. Without such evidence, it is not possible to justify the claim.\n",

      "contradiction---2099--------------------\n",
      "Yes, we can determine the validity of the claim based on the information provided. The statement \"The Shins are an indie rock band from Portland, Oregon\" is valid because it is supported by the given information that states, \"The band is based in Portland, Oregon.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Although The Shins were originally formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1996, the band's current lineup and base of operations are in Portland, Oregon. This information confirms that The Shins can indeed be considered an indie rock band from Portland, Oregon.\n",

This aligns with the claim that the band released their first full-length record a year after signing with Victory Records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the claim states that the band released their second full-length album, \"Dead, Everywhere,\" two years after releasing their first full-length record, \"Violence.\" The information provided states that \"Dead, Everywhere\" was released on January 27, 2015. Since \"Violence\" was released in 2013, it is indeed two years before the release of \"Dead, Everywhere.\" \n",

      "The information states that the song was recorded by Ciara and 50 Cent for Ciara's second album. It further mentions that the song was written by Ciara, LaShawn Daniels, Rodney Jerkins, and 50 Cent. This information directly supports the claim in question.\n",

      "To determine if the claim is valid, we need to establish whether Berger would have been 30 years old at the time of winning the Golden Globe for La La Land. \n",
      "\n",
      "The year in which Berger won the Golden Globe is not explicitly mentioned in the information provided. However, we can deduce that the Golden Globe was awarded in 2016 because it is stated that Berger won the award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for \"La La Land,\" which was released in 2016. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Berger was born on May 10, 1981, we can calculate his age in 2016. Subtracting 1981 from 2016 gives us 35. Therefore, at the time of winning the Golden Globe in 2016, Berger would have been 35 years old, not 30 as claimed.\n",

      "Based on the evidence provided, we can conclude that the claim \"Berger was not 30 years old when he won a Golden Globe for La La Land\" is indeed valid.\n",

      "\n",
      "Additionally, the information specifies that the Joseph Groome Towers were built as public housing. In many cases, public housing buildings follow specific regulations and guidelines regarding their construction, including the number of stories they can have. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if the information mentions the Joseph Groome Towers as thirteen-story buildings, it is accurate.\n",
