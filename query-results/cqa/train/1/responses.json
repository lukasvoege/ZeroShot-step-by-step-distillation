This can be achieved by reducing portion sizes, cutting back on high-calorie foods, and being mindful of overall calorie intake.\n\n3) Engage in regular physical activity: Increasing stamina and getting fitter can be achieved through regular exercise. A combination of cardiovascular exercises (such as running, cycling, or swimming) and strength training can help burn calories, build muscle, and improve overall fitness.\n\n4) Incorporate strength training: Building muscle mass can help increase metabolism and burn calories even when at rest. Including strength training exercises, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, can help achieve this.\n\n5) Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help control appetite, improve digestion, and aid in weight loss.\n\n6) Get enough sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for weight management. Lack of sleep can disrupt hormone levels, leading to increased hunger and cravings.\n\n7) Seek support: Joining a support group, seeking guidance from a healthcare professional, or having a workout buddy can provide motivation and accountability throughout the weight loss journey.\n\nIt's important to note that losing mass in a healthy way takes time and consistency.
