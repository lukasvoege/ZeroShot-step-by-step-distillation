So, we can set up the equation: 30x = 420.\n\nWe also know that together with the other game, they earned 22 dollars. So, the total earnings from both games in 30 days is 420 + 22 = 442 dollars.\n\nNow, we can set up another equation to find the amount earned by the other game.

To do that, we can multiply the second equation by -1 and add it to the third equation:\n-1(29x - y) = -1(-22),\n-29x + y = 22.\n\nNow, we can add the equations:\n29x - y + (-29x + y) = -22 + 22,\n0 = 0.\n\nThis means that the value of x is not determined by the equations.

Jessica threw away 4 roses, so the number of roses in the vase decreased by 4: 2 - 4 = -2.\n\nAfter throwing away the roses, Jessica cut x roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. The number of roses in the vase increased by x: -2 + x = x - 2.\n\nFinally, there are 23 roses in the vase. So we have the equation x - 2 = 23.\n\nTo find the value of x, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation: x - 2 + 2 = 23 + 2.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get x = 25.\n\nTherefore, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden."}

If the machine can make 8 shirts in 1 minute, we can set up a proportion to find the time it took to make 13 shirts:\n\n8 shirts / 1 minute = 13 shirts / x minutes\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n\n8x = 13\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we find:\n\nx = 13 / 8\nx \u2248 1.625 minutes\n\nSo, it took approximately 1.625 minutes to make 13 shirts.\n\nNext, we'll find the time it took to make 3 shirts. Using the same proportion, we have:\n\n8 shirts / 1 minute = 3 shirts / y minutes\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n\n8y = 3\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we find:\n\ny = 3 / 8\ny = 0.375 minutes\n\nSo, it took approximately 0.375 minutes to make 3 shirts.\n\nFinally, we'll add the times together to find the total time:\n\n1.625 minutes + 0.375 minutes = 2 minutes\n\nTherefore, the machine worked for a total of 2 minutes."}

We start with 5 children on the bus.\n2. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus. This means that the number of children on the bus decreased by 63.\n3. After the children got off the bus, there were 14 children altogether on the bus. This means that the number of children on the bus increased by 14.\n4. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we need to calculate the difference between the number of children who got on and the number who got off.\n5. The number of children who got on the bus is 14, and the number who got off is 63. Therefore, we have 14 - 63 = -49.\n6. The final answer is -49. However, since we are looking for the number of additional children who got on the bus than those that got off, we can ignore the negative sign and take the absolute value.\n7. Taking the absolute value of -49 gives us 49.\n\nSo, 49 more children got on the bus than those that got off."}
